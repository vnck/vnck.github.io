## Mind Wondering

The human mind wanders. This phenomenon which neuroscientists collectively call [mind wandering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind-wandering) has a rich literature, with a consensus that:
- mind wandering constitutes a unique mental state i.e., the [default mode network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network) of the human brain.[^Christoff2009]
- it is characterised by the generation of stimulus-independent thoughts, which are defined as[^Buckner2008] 
    > Thoughts about something other than events originating from the environment; they are covert and not directed toward performance of the task at hand.
- colloquially, we recognise this as zoning out, daydreaming, shower thoughts, or [system 1 thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow).

In other words, in the absence of cognitive tasks, the mind can't help but wander.

There is plenty of literature associating mind wandering to increased creativity and problem-solving.[^Tan2015][^Angoli2018][^Baird2012] Anecdotally, I find that many of my ideas arrive to me as stimulus-independent thoughts, unprompted and often in the middle of some unrelated activity.

Given that stimulus-independent thought constitutes a unique mental state, we can develop protocols to promote them productively and by association, improve our creativity—a _protocol for wondering_.

## Protocols

Huberman's [podcast episode](https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-of-creativity-and-how-to-enhance-creative-innovation/) on creativity mentioned two protocols for boosting stimulus-independent thought generation, which he refers to as [divergent thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergent_thinking).
  
1. Open monitoring thinking[^Fujino2018]  
	A perceptual exercise to practice non-judgemental and non-reactive awareness, where every sensation or thought is simply regarded as a content for observation. This is also interpreted as suppression of auto-biographical narratives—the consideration of dependent facts, limiting possible thoughts—so as to allow boundary exploration to occur.

2. Physical activity[^Kuo2016]  
    There is research suggesting that physical movement can boost divergent thinking. Activities that don't require great conscious sensory attention are able to engage the same pseudo-random neural pathways that facilitates stimulus-independent thoughts.

So far, I can attest to the efficacy of physical activity. I've found consistently that the best ideas often come to me in the gym or the post-jog cooling down.
