September 2021. With the texture of the graduate certificate still lingering on my fingertips, I started the job hunt. I begun my expedition with three expectations, the distillation of four years of education and rumination over what the next ten odd years of my life should look like[^1]. Expectations are an invitation for disappointment, but I thought these expectations as the minimal leading lines to guide my search. These are the expectations.

## Expectation 1: Mentorship

To flourish in any environment requires learning its limits and boundaries, establishing the freedom of movement possible within the space (and how malleable the walls are). Yet, when one crash—lands into the working environment, it is very much like falling into an alternate universe with an unencountered laws of physics. Most learned signposts for flourishing in the previous environment no longer apply. Take took too long to establish the rules of the game, and I would be swept away by the motions of work and carried in circles, without any self-induced trajectory.  
From this, I saw the necessity of a mentor, someone whose experience I could bootstrap off, someone whose own trajectory might inspire my own.

## Expectation 2: Interest

I consider myself very strongly motivated by interest. It is a strong metric I use to prioritise projects. In the past few years, my interests have also somewhat stabilised, having amassed a set that I can feasibly tap on. A consequence is that anything outside my sphere of interest is likely to be de-prioritised. On that note, I believe that interest and ownership are strongly intertwined—two properties we depart onto things. Interest is the spark but ownership keeps the flame going. Of course, interest cannot make up the whole picture[^2] , but it a signal that has not failed me.

## Expectation 3: Flexibility

Since my first summer internship during my undergraduate studies, I knew that a 9 to 5 job wasn’t sustainable for me in the long term. Just the expectation that I was to abide to a regular work hour schedule filled me with dread—because it just didn't make sense to me. I think I'm quite attuned to how my work output varies through the day, and a regular schedule conflicts with how I would optimise my own schedule. The same can be said about the expectation to be in the office. I attribute this to a personal fault, in that I think I'm quite influenced by the environment I am working in, and somehow a typical sterile office environment just doesn't inspire me as much as working in a cafe or a school campus[^3]. And as a data scientist where a certain level of creativity is a much needed trait, this can be detrimental.  
To that, I am thankful that the pandemic has forced us to reckon with these legacy expectations, and I hope that the flexibility offered now becomes more than a stopgap measure and instead a permanent culture.

## The fulfillment of expectations

Having been in my current company for almost a year, I will say that not all three of my expectations were met immediately. I guess that's why I was undecided on calling them wishes or expectations, for I knew that they were in fact difficult, and I would be less disappointed if wishes were not fulfilled than if expectations were not met[^4]. But calling them expectations lends certain accountability no my part to ensure that they are met, and the initial unfulfillment only reaffirmed their importance for me. Fortunately since, some changes in the currents have landed me on okay ground for now.
