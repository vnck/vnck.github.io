## Mind Wandering

The human mind wanders. This phenomenon which neuroscientists call [mind wandering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind-wandering)[^Christoff2009], has been extensively researched on, with the consensus that mind wandering constitutes a unique mental state and is the [default mode network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network) of the human brain—that is, in the absence of cognitive tasks, the mind can't help but wander.

In this mode, the brain produces stimulus-independent thoughts[^Buckner2008], which are defined as 
> Thoughts about something other than events originating from the environment; they are covert and not directed toward performance of the task at hand. 

Colloquially, we recognise this as zoning out, daydreaming, shower thoughts.

There are studies finding that mind wandering to be associated with creativity and problem-solving.[^Tan2015][^Angoli2018][^Baird2012] Anecdotally, I also get many ideas originating as stimulus-independent thoughts, which because of their un-anticipatory nature, prompts me to always keep my phone close, so that I can quickly jot them down whenever they come.

Being a mental state suggests that we can develop protocols to improve our ability to mind wander productively and by association, improve our creativity.

## Protocols for Mind Wandering

Huberman's [podcast episode](https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-of-creativity-and-how-to-enhance-creative-innovation/) on creativity mentions two protocols for boosting divergent thinking—which is another way to label the process of generating SITs.
  
1. **Open monitoring thinking**[^Fujino2018]  
	A perceptual exercise to practice non-judgemental and non-reactive awareness, where every sensation or thought is simply regarded as a content for observation. This is also interpreted as suppression of auto-biographical narratives—the consideration of dependent facts, limiting possible thoughts—so as to allow boundary exploration to occur.

2. **Physical activity**[^Kuo2016]  
    There is research suggesting that physical movement can boost divergent thinking. Activities that don't require great conscious sensory attention are able to engage the same pseudo-random neural pathways that facilitates stimulus-independent thoughts.

While I haven't tried Open Monitoring Thinking, I can attest to the efficacy of physical activity. I've found consistently that the best ideas often come to me while I'm in the shower, taking a walk, or in the gym.
