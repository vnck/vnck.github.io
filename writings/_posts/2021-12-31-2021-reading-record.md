This year, I managed to read 56 books in total, of which 31 were non-fiction🟨 and 25 fiction🟥:

That bulk of non-fiction reading in the middle of the year can largely attributed to finishing my master's thesis. Turns out when I don't have a deadline, I find the time to read more fiction books.
### Non-Fiction

Of the non-fiction books, I read cross 10 genres: Anthropology👨‍👩‍👧, Economics💵, Essays📃, Feminist👩🏻‍💼, Memoir🪞, Politics🏛, Research🧐, Self-Help🌱, Technology🛠, Urbanism🏘:

🏘🛠🛠💵🏘🛠📃📃  
👩🏻‍💼🧐👨‍👩‍👧🛠🧐🛠🛠🛠  
🏘🪞🪞🛠🏛📃🌱🛠

My most-read genre was once again technology (13).

### Fiction

Of the fiction books, I read across 7 genres: Classics🦉, Fantasy🦄, Feminist👩🏻‍💼, History⌛️, Horror👻, Sci-Fi👽, Short Stories📖:

👽🦄👽👽👽👽👽🦄  
🦄👩🏻‍💼👻⌛️👽🦄👻👽  
🦉🦄🦄📖📖🦄📖👻👻

My most-read genre was sci-fi (8), overtaking fantasy from the previous year.

### Recommendations

Of these 56 books, I gave 13 books 🦷—meaning they were good to sink your teeth into. These books are:

- Circe _by Madeline Miller_
- The Lifecycle of Software Objects _by Ted Chiang_
- To Be Taught, If Fortunate _by Becky Chambers_
- Against the Smart City _by Adam Greenfield_
- I Love Dick _by Chris Kraus_
- The Loss of The Creature _by Walker Percy_
- Everything I Know About Love _by Dolly Alderton_
- Breaking Things At Work _by Gavin Mueller_
- Tools for Conviviality _by Ivan Illich_
- The Atlas of AI _by Kate Crawford_
- Air-Conditioned Nation Revisited _by Cherian George_
- Your Computer Is On Fire _edited by Thomas S. Mullaney, Bejamin Peters, Mar Hicks, Kavita Philip_
- Warmth _by Daniel Sherrell_

I think I achieved my resolution to read more widely, and somehow managed to read more than 50 books. I think for the coming year, my goals remain the same.
