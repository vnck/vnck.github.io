When life catches us in a whirlwind, we first yearn for its storm to end, to return us to the unmoving ground, to allow us to feel the sands of time slip through our fingers. And so we yearn for blue and golden hours, we yearn for slow evenings, we hide in sleepless nights.

And yet, in the rare moments where the storm settles and chaos subsides, when the mind has time to ponder its reflection against the river of time, oh how quickly do we get bored of the peace. And after that, comes sin. "I sinned, because I was bored." has become the common confession of the modern Christian.

The amnesia settles quick. When time becomes plenty, as if time had always been plenty, we find that time to be empty and so we feel empty, a husk weathered by time. So we attempt to fill it and we lift it to the altar of temptation, sacrificing time to sin whose returns are easy and so satisfying, so alive. Monotony bred boredom and boredom bore sin, the death that produces the false impression of life. Yet, it need not be, if we see that the time given to us is not empty, not lifeless, if we see the goodness of persevering in monotony.

The perseverance in monotony reveals not a lack of life, but the revelling in life. The child that crys "again!" and "again!" with glee revels in the monotonous life. The crowd that cries "encore!" wishes upon themself monotony and is fulfilled in it. Yet, the one who revels most in monotony might be our Father in heaven. 

>"It is possible that God says every morning, "Do it again" to the sun; and every evening, "Do it again" to the moon. It may not be automatic necessity that makes all daisies alike; it may be that God makes every daisy separately, but has never got tired of making them. It may be that He has the eternal appetite of infancy; for we have sinned and grown old, and our Father is younger than we." â€”

>_Orthodoxy, G.K. Chesterton_

For monotony is not empty. Rather, monotony brims with life, allowing us to feel our heartbeat in the stillness, allowing us to wonder upon the heavy silence. Monotony is an enabler, an opportunist. She fuels creativity, curiosity and pursuit for the invisible things, the patient things. Strength in monotony is patience, steadfastness and endurance. These virtues do not fall from the tree of trials alone.

May we then not merely persevere in monotony but revel and vitalize in it, to then face the whirlwind with restored vigour and unjaded eyes. *May we come alive in monotony.*
