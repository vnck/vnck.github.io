Games are full of emotional experiences, conveyed through the narrative, to evoke empathy in the character, immerse the player into the story, or make gameplay more meaningful. However, these emotional experiences are often only experienced in solitary gameplay.

Yet, research in human emotions have shown that emotion is not just an intrapersonal phenomenon. People have a tendency to recount their emotional experiences to others. This interpersonal process is called the social sharing of emotions (Rimé 1991).

When people share their emotional experiences, they are opening opportunities for bonding, empathy, and entertainment. The act of sharing is a means of strengthening relationships (Rimé 2007). 

Thus, emotional experiences are part of a social emotional process and can be used to foster social interactions. Taking from the study of social sharing of emotions, we can gain design insight towards building emotional experiences in multiplayer games.

## Sharing Positive Emotions

Langston (1994) proposes that positive emotional episodes are opportunities to "capitalise".

Capitalising on emotional experiences then serves to: enhance one's positive affect, enhance the social bond between the shared party.

Needless to say, emotional experiences designed to evoke positive emotions can strengthen relationships between players.

Positive emotions in games (and in real life) result from events that facilitate goal-reaching activities. Therefore, goals must be clearly defined, whether belonging to the player or the character, and there must be a sufficient feedback when an action brings the player or character closer to the goal.

Having superordinate goals shared between multiple members can boost social activity in a game. These can manifest as party missions or public boss battles.

## Sharing Negative Emotions

People exposed to negative emotional experiences are motivated to seek social contact (Schachter 1959). Schachter believed that when people face such conditions, they attempt to reduce their elicited emotions by interacting with others sharing the same fate, as a means of a gauge for their own emotional state. Sharing negative emotional experiences with others also serves as a means of direct distress reduction and a source of emotional support.

Furthermore, sharing negative experiences have been shown to encourage cooperation and other pro-group behaviours. Here, the negative experiences serve as a common identity between the group.

Therefore, negative emotional experiences can be designed to strengthen social bonds. These emotions could be those of pain, sadness, or loss.

However, negative emotional experiences can be distressing to players and therefore, a period of low intensity should be granted after the experience to allow players to interact and distress.

The tone of the scene after should not be too jarring lest players be confused and unable to reconcile their lingering negative emotions.

## Avoiding Shame and Guilt

Though a study showed that the intensity of emotion did not influence the social sharing of the event, some events associated to certain emotions of shame and guilt were less frequently shared (Rimé 2005). This emotions are associated with the concealment of self and undermines one's confidence. Hence, they are experiences to be kept in private.

In the context of gameplay, emotional experiences in games that illicit shame and guilt in the players should be avoided. Such events are those that might humiliate or scorn the player for the decisions they made in the game.

Emotional events that evoke shame and guilt in the characters are an exception as they evoke compassion and care from the players. By letting the characters make mistakes, they become for fleshed out and real to the players, which improves players' immersion into the game and empathy for characters.

## Caveats

Emotional experiences are draining to the players and should not be implemented too frequently. There should be ample time between high intensity events for players to calm their emotional states. Events should also not be too emotionally jarring as human emotions are not circumstantial and linger even after the emotional event. Breaking the flow of emotion can break the immersive experience for the players and ruin gameplay.

Furthermore, a good narrative often follows a plot structure drawn from a cultural pool of plots. Players come to expect these plots and steering away from them can be narratively confusing to players. Furthermore, a good plot structure can amplify the emotions of an event. For example, a good build-up to a climax amplifies its intensity. Therefore, designers shoud be aware of plot structures and implement them to their advantage.

## Conclusion

In using emotional events to foster relationships, one must be aware that people are highly sensitive about their emotions and what evokes an emotional response. Therefore the content of the emotional event should be sensitive to the player group's circumstances (e.g. avoiding controversial topics). Players already have a propensity to share in emotional events and thus, the game should provide space for doing so without undermining player experience.

As a bonus point, emotional experiences are a way to strengthen social bonds in games but also outside the game through the effect of secondary social sharing (Christophe 1997).
