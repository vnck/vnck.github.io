The blog lives again (2 years later). A new blog freshly minted in Gatsby to reflect yet another turn in the road, hence the metamorphosis.

### What to expect

The goal is simply to write more, and this the medium.

Projects are ever ongoing (I don't think that part of me will ever go away) but they will be of a different note and flavour, hopefully one that reflects my growth.

In the meantime, stay safe in the pandemic.
