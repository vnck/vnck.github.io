Hello Reader,

In this entry, I think it worth to bring to your attention, several object and notions of attention. The metaphors of attention are many, but I'm sure these you will find familiar: paying attention, some days I portion my attention as a scarce resource and choose to whom I give it to; caught my attention, other days attention is wrenched from my being, and I am entangled and have to pull myself off.

Here, I lay the beginnings of a framework for attention, and I hope that you might find it useful in managing your own.

Many are familiar with attention being described as an affordance, a resource that we all inherently own and to be portioned and given. It is the currency of the [attention economy](https://econreview.berkeley.edu/paying-attention-the-attention-economy/). In reality however, I find that this currency is not something we give, but something that is taken from us. According to media theorists, [attention is a product of when machines operate on us](https://comparativemedia.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/Anthropology%20Quarterly.pdf). It is a result, and effect, and we might as well [call it what it is](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/106313-the-beginning-of-wisdom-is-to-call-things-by-their), distraction. Thus, a 'distraction economy' which manufactures objects of trapping, that distracts us.

Film theorist, [Siegfried Kracauer](https://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~fc76/Handouts/10__Distraction_Notes.html) presents that we desire for distraction because we are exhausted by attention demanding labour. He is speaking of the trend where our machines of labour are becoming more self-operating, and thus we labour with attention instead of knowledge. Having exhausted attention, workers then seek leisure in distraction and optical palaces.

L. M. Sacasas wrote on why we are [so obsessed with baking bread](https://theconvivialsociety.substack.com/p/baking-bread-finding-meaning) during this pandemic. He introduces philosopher Borgmann's concept of focal things to explain why. [Focal things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_paradigm) are objects that have value in and of itself, rather than being a means of an end. Hence, they are not easy or convenient but demand practice, and our fullest attention. In doing so, they cultivate mastery and skill. In that sense, these are objects that are worth paying attention to. Then, what are the focal things in your life? I suppose it is more fulfilling when work involves focal things rather than devices.

The concept of focal things requiring your fullest attention brings to mind the idea of the [flow state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)). Coined by psychologist Mihály Csíkszentmihályi, it is a mental state of full immersion and focus. It is a state where your attention is fully given to the activity before you. I'm sure you have experienced it before in some form of work.

However, these days, we associate being in the flow state as a productivity measure. This was never the intent of Csíkszentmihályi. [His research only suggests that flow is conducive to optimal experience](https://aeon.co/essays/the-true-expert-does-not-perform-in-a-state-of-effortless-flow). Flow is popularly treated as a mechanised theory of mind for optimal performance; in reality, it only promises optimal experience.

I feel like this entry has been long enough and so I shall I would like so I think I should end it now on a tangent. Flow was not the only theory of mind to be mechanised. The [surrealism movement](https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/themes/surrealism/tapping-the-subconscious-automatism-and-dreams/) tried to mechanise Freudian's theory of mind for the production of art. What theories of mind do you mechanise in your daily operation of life?

Thanks for your attention,  
Ivan
