On April 7 2020, we entered into a period of _circuit breaker_, a lockdown. This was to last a month, but was later extended to 3 months.

## Contamination

just like any other day, I was minding,  
of all things, my own business,  
when a heavy pollen floated in and sunk itself,  
into the amygdaloid sea, disturbing the fishes.  
it landed with a thunk, a contamination,  
a confabulation.  
and, who knew, a buried stigma could.  
of course, matter does not just disappear,  
though emptiness can appear at whim,  
which isnâ€™t very fair.  
but enough talk, a season has passed,  
and thereâ€™s a bloom.  
but first iâ€™ve got to feed  
the fish,  
and hopefully, the bloomâ€˜s still there.  

## Bite

unbeknownst, and rather carelessly so,  
i entered into a season of gravity,   
not the one that stabilises the planets   
but as indifferent a force.  
that compelled me to shatter everything   
and lay each piece out like a  
poor mortalâ€™s attempt at lithomancy.  
once more, i remember the carob pod  
between my teeth and so rend to grit.  
piercing clarity, i enter into a space of eternity.   
progress ceases to exist,  
light shines through the cracks.  

## Unhinge

are you done with gorging the world,  
donâ€™t leave your jaw unhinged, itâ€™s unsightly.  
can you move on, or would you rather stay  
bobbing in the darkness youâ€™ve neglected.  
i hope you come to term with all youâ€™ve ingested,  
and your insides stir to primordial soup,   
before iâ€™m eaten too.  

##  ðŸŒ²

There is nothing to be said,  
as you yell into the forest knowing that the trees only understand the language of being rooted to the ground, and casting towards the sky, though you forget that the trees have a word for tremours, and a word for when a fire starts spreading eastward. and the hikers too, just for a moment, stop and look around, wary of what kind of beast could make such a sound.

## Metapod

So, lately i've been feeling like a metapod,  
hard-shelled and all but really, I just want to turn my insides out.  
When the butterflies start churning, I'll just spread it out like butter,  
all the goop and strange loops, all out of the water.  
but honestly, unless you're some god-like practitioner of anthropomancy,  
I doubt you'll make heads or tails of my entrails. I don't myself.  
But I've been far too long taciturn,  
I've swallowed all the ashes of the books I've burnt.  
Ingested, these notions like amino and I, Apollo, the catalyst,  
am lost in translation, live life an automation,  
waiting for my string shot to reach moonlight,  
the eyes of the moth see no distance at night.  
Yeah, this story isn't straight, the threadcraft not taut,  
but whatever, it's a piece of the night, a typical haunt.  
And given the circumstance, this providence,  
an intervention of the cosmic scale for something, maybe decadence,  
I'm sure we can be more forgiving and butterfree.
