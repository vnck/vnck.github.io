Dear Reader,

Admittedly, we live in a technologically-mediated world. That you are able to read these words, travelled through the [network of fragments](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/12/a-network-of-fragments/419469/), is only evidence of that. Communication channels grow and wither, in text, audio, [colour](https://sea.mashable.com/tech/8038/why-use-words-when-you-can-just-dm-friends-colorful-rectangles). I have chosen this channel to take the form of a newsletter, in a plenty of words. In what serendipitous form of way that you have found yourself here, I hope that what I write you might enjoy, and even take away something from it, [a seed or a fruit](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden). ðŸŒ±

The newsletter form is particularly appealing for what I seek to achieve with this channel. In its length and frequency, I hope that its entries might serve as moments of social engagement in [slow time](https://jackcheng.com/the-slow-web/), an intermission between the infinite stream of fleeting triviality and performance of social media. In some sense, this is my small protest against the [liturgy of the web of consumption](https://theconvivialsociety.substack.com/p/children-and-technology).

What you can expect is a synthesis of ideas, a dispatch of thoughts, a sharing of curiosities. For me as writer, this is a practice in communication and association. For you as reader, I hope that the things you read might open up possibilites and paradigms.

There is no plan, no schedule, no end-goal, except to simply write more. For now, I have just simply laid a seed and we'll see together, what abounds.

Till the next,

Ivan
