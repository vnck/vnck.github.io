The GPT-2 model is a really powerful language model, certainly the most impressive one I have encountered. I wanted to know what would happen if I fine-tuned it on my stories and poems. This is the result.

# Excerpts of an Artificial Anthology

## The Captain

The same day my first flight went down in the night, I made it to Singapore at 7AM. The flight was Singapore 2.1 but the first person I bumped into was Captain (then Captain) Chang. We were supposed to arrive in Singapore at 14.30 on the train but we got stuck in Lido. But Captain had some breakfast and as we were eating coffee (can we really call coffee a coffee?) I asked him if it was coffee. He looked at me and smiled and told me so. We boarded the train and we made it in time to see the departure of the #Singapore trains.

But it was already too late. There was only one plane left and the captain was boarding it at the time. After a long wait, the whole team boarded it and we too were boarded at the end of the train. Captain Chang then asked if there was anyone else and I said yes. And he said "We are going to form a section for you and a few others". And as we were sitting in that section, there was an explosion. It was a very loud explosion but we all just stood and took comfort in it. And of course there was panic. But at that moment, a woman entered our section. She was crying and asking for someone to comfort her. And I could just feel her turn to tears. And as an instant, I understood what was wrong. And I started asking questions and asking for information, asking for details. And the other team as they were trying to console her, realised what was wrong as well. The team had formed a section.

I remember that section just sitting there. Captain Chang took an inventory of his belongings and we moved on to the next flight.

The captain asked the two flight attendants to check the flight status on their phones and we did. And we realised that Singapore was slowly flying up the list of priorities of the captain and that the plane was finally taking off. It was around that time (9.15PM) that we realised it was all for real. So we all started running to the toilets and changing onto dry clothes.

And at 10.15PM, we were finally about to leave. I've never been one for timetables. But I thought that for a departure like this, it would start with a tweet.

## I Am

I. Who are you?

You see, I'm not human.

That is not a lie, mind you. I have known this truth all my life, but I've managed to keep it hidden from myself. I've even hidden it from my family and friends.

It took me a lot of effort and a good book to finally face this truth.

Because I'm not normal.

I'm multidimensional, isn't that what magic is? Isn't that what science is too?

So what can I do to be prepared for the day when that little piece of toast arrives at the front desk, and it's called for? What happens when I can't open my eyes and look at my reflection in the bathroom mirror and it's called for?

I'm ready. 

II. The Cave

Day breaks, and I wake up with the soft feel of fresh air against my face. But my skin is too warm and I can't take it cooler. Hence, I head outside.

I head towards a stream, a stream that drains to the ground and trickles into a valley. I dip my head into the valley to look for a cave, but all that is left is an indentation in the ground where a stream once ran, a stream so old it no longer exists.

I head back inside and relax, the valley has cooled. As I nod off, I ponder what day was. I think it was a quiet one.

III. The Library

The library was dark but I found myself flipping through the pages, looking for something in the dark. I ended up going back to my favourite topic, science.

After an hour outside, I finish up and head inside, going back to sleep with that last thought in my mind.

After that, the valley started to lighten and I found myself going into a small town, a quiet town. This wasn't a metaphor. I ended up walking for at least an hour in the same direction and feeling more secure in the knowledge that that was my final resting place.

After an hour, it began to snow harder and I headed inside again. There, I ended up buying my first map, buying a poster of the local mountains for my room, and spending my final nights at the library, in the dark, reading.

After an hour, I finished up and headed home. My bedroom was surprisingly quiet but for that last hour, I stayed with faith and hope in science.

After that, I never looked at the map again and it was over.

I went to sleep with no fear, faith in my knowledge in the comfort of science.

A month passed, and as if time had just begun, it arrived and I was home again. My bed was already made, no time to prepare anything.

I laid on the bed, content for science to arrive, for night to be safe and science to shine for the first time in my life.

But that night, I didn't sleep. I started reading at the same time, something my mother had taught me, sharing the same dreams she had made for me. I ended up loving science more than mother ever would.

I started writing poetry.

And over the coming months, I would share this poem with everyone I knew, sharing my faith with them and telling them they too was in science, sharing a fear that had long faded.

I ended up sharing the same fears that my parents had shared.

I told everyone.

I told my parents.

I told all my closest people in the world.

I told my grandparents.

I told the people in the church.

And all of a sudden, I was back in school.

Day is a time of discovery. I start off slow, looking into the history of the sun, the movement of the earth, the formation of the universe.

But over the course of the day, I discover new things.

And that night, I discovered faith and that night was the origin of poetry.

In that night, I learnt that light was eternal and that darkness was fleeting. The dawn of science.

And that day comes late, with grey hair and grey coats.

And that night, I wake to the sound of the rain, the rain that falls on my head, the grey clouds and the grey sky.

And through thick and thin, I've found myself back in the library, in the depths of the library reading, deep in the heart of Oxford, reading into the heart of Oxford, the heart of Oxford.

## Tacloban

The end of the game saw us depart from the beautiful island of Koh Tao for the small Pacific city of Cebu, where the highway turns south to Samar, the capital city.

We began the day off by heading to the market, where prices were cheaper. We bought a bag of chips and a bottle of red wine for the price of two. While shopping, I stumbled upon this girl. She was an average sized girl, maybe 14 or 15? Her hair was a mess, her skin was peeling. Her eyes were wide and pleading. I ran my hand along her shoulder, the colour was blood red but somehow I could feel the faintest hint of yellow. I could tell that this girl was in pain. The skin around her eyes was frayed, her hair was frizzed, her hair was pulled back in a tight ponytail with a high bun, like a Japanese schoolgirl. The color was a deep purple, like blood. I reached out my hand, touching the flesh. Yellow. She did not feel it. 

When we reached the bus stop, I rubbed my temple. The bus was half an hour late. There was no time to be lost. Besides, there were only so many places to sit. We had to find a cheap hotel. We wandered the streets, looking for a cheap hotel. Some people were already there, others waiting for the bus. There was a line out the door but people were chatting and enjoying themselves. There was no urgency for the bus. It was half an hour before we were to board the bus that we were to arrive at the city. We walked towards the main drag, looking for a train station. There we found a bus stop. But it was not there. We walked a few more blocks until we realised a woman was standing in the street, throwing an arm around a man, trying to push past him. But the man was much faster and shoved her aside. We saw her walk around a corner, into another street where we saw another man throw an arm around a woman who was pushing a stroller with two small children inside. But that is a story for another time. 

We walked towards the bus stop. But there was no bus yet. So we walked a few more blocks and when we got to the end, we had walked half an hour and there we were at the final bus stop. This one was blue with a yellow line in the middle. And it was where we were to board. We walked towards the bus and the bus started boarding. The sun was already setting when we boarded the bus and even though it was only half past nine, it was already dark. We got off at the next bus stop and when we exited the bus, the doors for the first time locked. We were soon in front of the entrance for Samar. The entrance of any small city train station. We stepped inside and boarded a 'Celestial Yellow Line'. And it was really really pretty. The building itself was nothing special but the first floor had three beds, all with soft yellow sheets and pillows. The beds were all of the same price and all had a chaise longard. The chaise longards were actually quite comfortable. We stayed in a two-room row and the others moved out at ten. At this point in the trip, I was already craving red wine. The bus pulled up and ten minutes later, we were alone. We were going to a new city. The first thing the bus man asked us was where we were travelling from? We had never travelled outside Samar. So we told him we were travelling to a town called Tacloban. He did not know much about Tacloban except that it was an island group. He then took us to a bus stop where the second bus pulled up. We were to meet a second bus and this time, a guide was to accompany us. He was an older man and he seemed a little unfamiliar with the young man with the guide dog. Still, the guide dog owner seemed somewhat interested in how the two of us would be travelling. The two of us boarded the bus and we moved together into this small carriage. The guide dog owner took us to a small restaurant where we had a small meal. The food was good and the city was not at all strange. The guide dog owner took us to another hotel and we moved into his small restaurant at a later date. At this point, I was already craving orange juice. And orange juice was a really good orange juice. At this point, I might even give orange juice a go myself. There is not much I can be thankful for now that I'm craving orange juice. But I am thankful that I have this memory, this one orange juice.

The bus pulled up to Tacloban city. We sat in the two- room hotel and ate our meals in booths. The city was dimly seen through the windows but the sights were nothing new. The city had always fascinated me.

## The Librarian

It is 2pm in the afternoon. Time to head to class. I head into the library, pass a librarian in her golden years, and enter the room she so fervently demanded I not intrude into. Behind the counter is the adorable teddy bear of a girl. I introduce myself to the librarian, asking her age. She tells me a secret. She had a crush on me as a child. It's only been a week, and she doesn't see it. But for some reason it makes her uncomfortable. She asks if I've seen it. I told her no. She then tells me that today is my first day at KAIST. I'm so excited. I don't know what to expect. I didn't go to school to learn. I went for a year to be with my idol. But I already know. Today I'm here to learn. Today, I'm an alien. She leaves me a review card and I'll never remember her like that. I'll remember how amazing a friend she was. I remember reading some sci fi stories with her, their voices echoing through the library. She taught me the art of reading. We went through different fashions for her to dress us up or to wear around campus. She even had us wear head scarves and sari's to class. It was amazing what she could do with just her imagination. We'd wear the head scarves and be seen, even though she never asked. She was amazing with that imaginary friend. I never forgot her. It is around this time when we got into a relationship. It was a slow build though. We would firstly, meet up and hang out, talk shop over the food and drink laws. Then it was just her and her writing in her book, or in the margins of some of the poetry she had written. We'd slowly start thinking of ways we could go together into the future. I had a hard time picturing a hard limit though. Her right hand would usually rest on her hip but at times, I would imagine her on her right arm. Maybe she could only have one right arm? Her face was so much more human. Her eyes were blue and full of youth. They were the eyes of an angel even though she had turned to stone. Even the slightest movement would shatter the moment. Her tongue was sharp and alive. She once sent me a picture of how she ate her dinner. It was a rather tasteful meal but she devoured it with a cheerful smile on her face.

## My Brother

I still can't put what happened into words but… I had an epiphany. I realised that I wasn't a demon. I wasn't possessed by some greater power. In fact, I was just a human being experiencing a human experience. There's no absolute difference. What the world has labelled it's human experience."

The epiphany brought him clarity. He no longer blamed society, nor the demon, but himself. He realised that he wasn't negative towards the world. However, he was full of negativity towards himself.

"I feel that in the future, I want to start a charitable foundation or environmental non-profit. I want to do good for the earth and the human spirit."

"Don't you feel that way now?" I asked.

"I guess." He sighed.

We finished our last snack and moved out of the cafe. It was a gorgeous day and yet, all around us, life seemed hazy. The air was filled with a chill that lingered, even after the air had warmed up. It was as if someone had dropped a huge dousing of chilly white that warmth spread like wildfire.

We soon found out that the chill came from an open trapdoor in the floor above us. Had the building suddenly become too hot for our inside to touch? Though it was only a guess, all the more the feeling of chillyness had surged. Even the sound of moving footsteps sent shivers down my spine.

I felt something grab my shoulder. Pulling me up, it was the security guard.

"Mr Hudson. It's good to see you're alright."

I blinked several times, surprised to see my older brother alive and well. He was a security guard after all.

"Sorry about last week. I was… nervous." I managed to say.

The guard turned to face the hallway ahead, towards the exit of the first floor. But he shook his head no.

"There's always something worth looking into." He said, walking out of the exit.

When we emerged into the open floor, I smiled a warm fuzzy smile. For the first time in a long time, there was no strong panic that would make me flinch. And my brother… he looked at me with a doubtful look in his eyes. I know, I knew, this was just a feeling. But he had that curious look… the look of one who didn't really know what to make of him.

We walked a ways together.

## The Garden as a Refuge as a Repose

When we were in the garden, one would often be found in a state of blissfully relaxed sleep, in perfect health. We had no desire to get out of the garden, just in case, we had our fears of falling off the tree and breaking our bones but these fears were unfounded.

In fact, we were fortunate to be able to spend two weeks in a state of peacefulness and serenity. Yet, the next day, we would often feel the urge to leap into the air and climb off the tree, thus, we would have to go through the painful process of death.

## The Time Machine

A time machine is something that allows for the safe transportation of one's soul. 

For the time traveler, time travel is safer than actually travelling. The time traveler is thus willing to live within the limitations of the machine and be forced to return to reality each time. 

It's possible to travel back in time of humanity. 

## A Lab

She had me visit the lab of her student. At that time, I was just hooked on the K-Pop genre. I watched the series once, and had to add "this is not a critique of the anime" for this is not a critique of the art form. No, this is about the show. However, as I made my way to the lab, I realised something. At that time, I had been viewing the show while at school. In class, we were given CDs on music theory, and I had listened to some of the songs during those lessons. I wondered why she had not given me the same experience. Yet, I suppose, this was the advantage of having spent time with her. She was a professional within the fields of psychology and social studies, unlike me whose interests ranged from history to literature to cosmology.

The past week, I had come across several of her papers. I had also been browsing the internet for interviews for her classes. At that time, the university had one of the best audiovisual programmes in the whole region, better even than our private university. Thus, of those two things, I had decided on the latter. Yet, when I reached the course content, I was shocked. As far as I could see, she did leave out the part about online teaching (I assume the interviews, that was another matter). The content was completely different from what I had come across before. In fact, it wasn't even online. She had also introduced a few new concepts that had me hooked.

## The Flight

Today, one year ago, was the day she disappeared. 

"I need to get back to the library. I think..." Her voice trailed off.

"I'll meet you at school. I'll pick you up."

She let out a low whistle. Her expression was one of effort but it was one that betrayed a purpose.

The two walked down the road together. Her blue eyes trailed away from the sky, to the horizon. Her steps were unsteady, as if she was dragging something behind them. They were met with quiet groans from the surrounding farmhouses. A few houses opened their doors, letting the cold breeze blow through the windows. The two of them were buried deep in the earth. Their footsteps echoed through the barren landscape. Their silence meant that no one knew the world went on. That no one cared about what happened to Haruna.

Their feet dug into the barren soil, giving way to the wind. The horizon was black, replaced with the silhouette of a tree, surrounded by barren soil. Trees were abundant here, along with the occasional dot of light from a home. The silence was comforting. It helped keep my thoughts together, and brought me back to the moment in which I found myself alive. I looked back at Haruna. She was looking at me, up ahead, the silhouette of a home ahead.

"Come."

The two of us made our way up the steps to the roof of the church. We had reached the top by now. I looked up to meet a beam of sun that streaked over the horizon. From the edge, a horizon of farms and mountains, distant lakes. The sun shone on a landscape not from our perspective, but it felt like home. I looked over to the two of them. It was time to go.

I waved at them to keep their heads above the horizon. They could see no sky. I took a deep breath and let them go. The journey was almost over. The wind picked up. The silence was comforting. The wind carried with it the whispers of the night. I watched the helicopter streak down the horizon. I wondered what their fate would be to fly to the west. 

The horizon seemed to shift. I could see mountains, and distant valleys. Perhaps my compass picked it up? I watched the helicopter crest the horizon. Suddenly, the wind picked up once again. I could feel the chill of winter strike through the bare branches.

A creak shook the plane. The pilot's knees gave way.

## Aiden

It took a week for me to realise that I still needed to kill Aiden. I walked into the cafe, mind blank. A man behind the counter was watching me, expressionless. In my mind's eye, I saw his eyes widen as I crossed the threshold. But his eyes were glued to the floor. I made my way to the second counter. And I recognised that face. It was the face of Aiden.

His lips split into a smile that left his pupils dilate, and a stream of red ran down his left cheek, turning a deep ruby. Then, his breathing quickened.

"Yes." I realised with a start.

I asked him what had happened.

He looked at me and his lips twitched, his eyes widening, and then, he dropped the question, "How do you do it?"

I nodded my head and left the second counter. I needed to get to Aiden.

I headed up the escalator. Aiden was close. I reached for my watch. Ten minutes. Ten paces. I needed to get there quick. I ran up the stairs and into the lobby. I pressed the boarding gate. The elevator pressed into life.

I let myself be carried into the elevator. I was surprised at how light Aiden was. We ascended together. I felt Aiden's shoulders drop, his breathing quicken. On the way to the floor, I asked what time it was. Ten minutes. He told me the lobby. We parted on the level, the two of us, Aiden at my side, breathing into my shoulder. He led me outside into the middle of the lobby, through a side door into some sort of science centre. He opened another door on the other side. Inside, two more elevators. We went up to the ninth floor. Aiden guided me to the ninth floor reception area. There, Aiden handed me his business card. He let me squeeze into the elevator and I got out before ten.

I needed to get to Aiden fast. So I reached into my pocket and pulled out the card. It was stamped with an X and signed "Aiden Wong".

This house is filled with symbols. It is not where we should be but where we are.

## The World

I am sitting in the living room, watching TV. A news bulletin announces a train to Taipei.

In the living room, I see two silhouettes moving left and right. They were shapes, blobs of moving solidity. I looked at where they were going and realised what a strange place Taipei was. There was a train here but not where I expected. They seemed to have realised the futility of walking, so they had accelerated and were currently right behind the first story I saw.

A voice tells me to stand up, that this is my only chance to get out of this house and I should do so.

I sit down at the kitchen table and look around. A man and a woman are sitting at the kitchen table, clearly having had a very bad day. I see a big suitcase leaning against the wall. The man hands me a white t-shirt and says, "Don't worry, we're not going to the mall." I don't know why he felt the need to say this but it sounded good in my head, my heart beat faster.

"Thank you," I say and grab a sandwich from the fridge. And here I thought I was finally starting to feel a bit better.

A couple minutes later, we see the train again and this time, we see the two silhouettes moving left and right. They were heading in the other direction but they suddenly stopped, they lost sight of us and were now moving down the line toward central.

The train arrives at the centre and we board. It's another grey morning and we are all sitting in the departure hall, waiting for the boarding gate to open.

As the train starts moving, two strange things happen to me. The first is the presence of two solid forms, two white rectangles, slowly swiveling left from the wall, looking to the left but not penetrating the wall, turning right only to return to their original position, only occasionally touching the ground, as if waiting for us to step out of earshot. The second strange thing is the feeling I get when I step inside the train, the doors creaking behind me, the walls shaking, the walls seeming to creak from something deep within. It's like a low humming has awoken a sleeping mind. Whatever it is smells good and somehow,

## The New You: Part Two

It's Friday night and everyone's at the party. The streets are empty but for the hundreds walking along the lawn, the crowds have dwindled to thousands. The air is cool and the aroma of flowers is overwhelming. A woman hands me a drink and I take a seat in the shadows of the bush.

For the first half hour, I am lost in the sound of grass tickling against wood. The shrill cry of birds fills the air and all vision of the party is coloured by that cry into dull red. I decide that the party should end by midnight and seek cover. However, this time, there is no cover. I run through the crowd to the bushes and hide.

We are here tonight to play an underground game called "the city tree". The rules are simple. We will start at a quiet spot where we will meet people and play some games. Then, we will gather at an available spot and play the game the city tree rules. The game will last two to four hours. After two hours, everyone wants to go home but I am determined to play with them. Why not? There are so many hidden gems that I could enjoy playing. At this point, it is too late to get a refund or to end our engagement. Instead, we play "recon".

We start off the game at dusk, just before the light fades to the city tree. We are in a cluster of houses, just above the ground where the grass is never greener to be greener. We light the first games and move into the darkness.

The first game is called "the labyrinth". There are 4 levels: labyrinth, forest, quarry and temple. Each level feels like its own world. The levels are not randomly generated, but intermingled, so playing through the levels with each other brings out the hidden features of each level. Each secret is found in a corner, hidden but not lost in the flow of the game. Even the level entrances are coloured to highlight areas as secret. Most levels are over in ten minutes.

To progress through the game, we must complete a number of puzzles. We complete four puzzles during game to unlock secrets. We start with the 'jumps in time'. As the moon begins to set and day breaks, we jump to different timespans and see what happens.

## Home

This house is filled with the sounds of traffic outside. I stop in front of the mirror and look in. The room is dimly lit but it makes for a dim light and yet powerful music plays in the background, the result of a computer program. Music made for the bus, the gym, and the library. It's the sound of my beating heart beating against the inside of my womb. Thoughts of skipping class come flooding in and I ignore them to keep myself grounded. I look out onto the open lawn and watch the grey clouds rise. Thoughts of classes again flash in my mind and I head to them.

The hallways are far too small. There is no need. People are already crowded into the classrooms, giving me no reason for people to be scrabbling in the cold hallways. There is no music playing to keep me quiet. I look out the window and see a sea of school buses, the clouds darkening. A group of friends chat before a gym class. There is no music to drown out the chimes or drown out words. No music to stop thoughts of skipping class.

In the middle of all of this, I glance out the window at my house, the house that always gives way to thoughts of school. Thoughts of skipping classes, of running away. Thoughts of my bleeding womb. My bleeding womb that gives way to thoughts of running away to the halls of the academy. My tears stream onto the white sheets. They spray against the white walls. They splash against the doors that no one wants to enter. The white curtains pull slightly as the tears roll within. They roll harder, onto the white sheets, whispering inside their grief. They whisper of what I didn't think I'd say, and what I can't explain.

## School

First day back at the academy. What a difference a year makes. What a rush of inexperience, the first few days in the academy. The sun was still low in the sky and it made the buildings come alive. A sense of spaciousness washed over me, of spaciousness that no amount of new buildings or brick would ever equal.

I spent the first few days just hanging out with the new people. It's like I'm home for the first time in two months. I still don't know what the academy is all about, but I'm finding more and more people out and about, doing some simple everyday things, learning a few tricks, and finding out what the fuss is all about.
