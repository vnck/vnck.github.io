A proper time to conceive of a person is in the late afternoon of your birthday, when the significance of the day has mellowed and your head is left only with dark waters. It was from this viscous state did Sebastian take form and breathed his first breath.

In his childhood, you could not tell Sebastian apart from any other child. He played computer games and ate sweets instead of engaging in more substantial things like reading literature and learning to play an instrument. It was upon his enlistment into army at the age of nineteen however, that I imagined a great despair fell upon him, one that wrenched him off a path someone else might have paved for him. While militaristic comradery in a pressure cooker environment turned out inspiring for his peers, a hole grew in size, gradually opening up below Sebastian, till he fell right through.

After two years of national service, Sebastian enrolled in a university overseas. He flew off only two weeks after becoming a civilian again. The name and location of the university remains unnamed, for it is of little importance to me, or Sebastian. I imagined that he just wanted to get out of the country. There, Sebastian majored in computer science and excelled in it. He got into the dean's list. He also got himself a girlfriend.

Her name was Emma, though I, as well as Sebastian, shall call her Em. Em was an antropology major, in fact, the only one of the kind that Sebastian knew. They did not share any classes at all and for most of their first year, had existed parallel to each other. That all changed with one serendipitous moment in the library when Em could not get the printer working for an essay submission to a particulary irritable professor, and of which Sebastian was behind her, wondering why the girl in front of him was taking forever. She promised him coffee after his help (he kicked the printer to life), and that coffee bloomed into a two year relationship.

Sebastian ended his relationship with Em early in his senior year, over a really long letter which he slipped under the door of her dormitory one Wednesday morning. They did not hate each other, neither had done any unforgivable harm to the other. Their paths had simply diverged beyond saving. We can still be friends, Em had called him over the phone to say. However, Sebastian never did see Em again. And within two weeks, they had stopped replying each other's texts. Their worlds simply drifted along in a parallel existence once more.

It was during his final semester, did I imagine myself to be a fellow student in the same university, and the same major. Sebastian and I took a class together and ended up in the same project group. Sebastian thought it incredulous that he had never seen me around before and I simply concurred with him on the fact. Sebastian, with his friendly and helpful personality, had many acquaintances but not much friends, having spent a good two years thinking that he only needed the one. I imagined that I got along well with him enough for him to regard me as a friend and we spent a great time in each other's company, studying together and having meals, talking about esoteric matters that senior year students talk about when they realise that there isn't really a point in all the paper chase.

In the week before his graduation, Sebastian received an offer for a research position in a sister university in the neighbouring town. His original decision was to head back home and do his jobhunting at the comfort of his family home. I convinced him to do otherwise. If you go back, you'll never get out of that hole, I had said to him. Two weeks later, and Sebastian, with a luggage and the rest of his possessions to be sent by courier, headed of to the neighbouring town and started another life.

That was the full extent of my involvment with Sebastian. The rest of his history is, decidedly, no longer for me to write.
