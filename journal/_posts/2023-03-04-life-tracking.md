I started with a B5 grid-paper Muji ring-notebook, a journal I kept during my two years of national service. It's the only journal that I've successfully managed to commit to, owing to the abundance of free time in service.

I've been trying to build up again a habit of tracking this year, as a way to track progress towards personal goals, as a way to capture trends and habits in an effort to know myself deeper, but also as a way to capture snapshots of forgotten time, anchoring myself in the flux. Presently, I'm making the effort to track six aspects in total: exercise, finances, reading, fasting, sleep, and most recently, mood.

By the end of the year, I'll have a fun data visualisation project to do.
