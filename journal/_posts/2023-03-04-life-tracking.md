My personal history with life-tracking started with a B5 grid-paper Muji ring-notebook, a journal I kept during my two years of national service. It's the only journal that I've successfully managed to commit to, owing to the abundance of free time in service.

I've been trying to build a habit of tracking this year, as a way to track progress towards personal goals, but also to capture trends and habits in an effort to know myself deeper. Presently, I'm making the effort to track six aspects in total: exercise, finances, reading, fasting, sleep, and most recently, mood. I've somewhat streamlined the process, through a combination of apps, my apple watch, google sheets, and some python scripts.

By the end of the year, I'll have a fun data visualisation project to do.
