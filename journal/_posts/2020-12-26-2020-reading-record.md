In 2020, a managed to read  **48** books, a great achievement out from the pandemic.

Most of it was fiction (31), and my most read fiction genre was fantasy (11) (I'm a sucker for complex magic systems) followed by horror (10).

As for the non-fiction (17) genre, I mostly read books about technology (5), especially from the science, tech & society (STS) field.

My plan for 2021 is to read more widely (reading more memoirs!), but also maybe even read more, since this pandemic doesn't look like it's going away anytime soon.

Of the 48 books, I gave 9 books ðŸ¦·â€”meaning they were good to sink your teeth into. These books are:

- Unsong _by Scott Alexandar_
- The Grip of It _by Jac Jemc_
- The Rook _by Daniel O'Malley_
- The Secret History _by Donna Tartt_
- The Necromancer's House _by Christopher Buehlman_
- The Ethical Algorithm _by Aaron Roth and Michael Kearns_
- The Sacred and the Profane _by Mircea Eliade_
- Cloud Ethics _by Louise Amoore_
- Divine Fury _by Darrin M. McMahon_
