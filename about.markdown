# 👋🏼 Hi! 
I'm Ivan Chuang. I write mostly about urban and technological systems. 

Recently, this has been focused towards spatializing online social networks to derive geographically-localized insights for policy and planning.

🔍 I'm [looking for roles](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vnck/) in data science or urban research!
