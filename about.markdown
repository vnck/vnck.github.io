# 👋🏼 Hi!

I'm Ivan Chuang. I mostly write about experiences within technological and/or urban systems. I originally wanted to be a frontend engineer, but eventually specialised in data science, and now I also dabble in urban studies and social science. In other words, I care about design systems. 

I'm completing a M.Sc. in Urban Science, Planning and Policy @ SUTD in August this year, and am currently 🔍 [looking for roles](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vnck/) in data science or urban research!
