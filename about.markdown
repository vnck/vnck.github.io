# 👋🏼 Hi! 
I'm Ivan Chuang. Right now, I'm working on a master's thesis on Singapore's AI strategy. I studied computer science, specialising in data science and A.I., before pursuing a master's in urban science and policy.

🔍 I'm [looking for roles](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vnck/) in data science or urban research!

Because there's a pandemic going on, I've been [reading a lot](https://www.notion.so/d026112598e84b658e777b832cdcae50) 🙇🏻‍♂️
