I started the job hunt with the texture of the graduate certificate still lingering on my fingertips. I had arrived to the expedition predisposed with three expectations, a resulting distillation of four years of education and rumination over what the next ten odd years of my life should look like[^1]. To have any expectation at all brings opportunity for disappointment, but I thought of these expectations as leading lines aiding to expedite my search.

## Expectation 1: Mentorship

To flourish in any environment requires learning its limits and boundaries, establishing your freedom of movement within its space of possibilities (and how malleable the edges are.) Yet, when one parachutes from the space of university education (where the past five years were spent) to the space of the working environment, it is very much like coming out the end of a wormhole into an alternate universe where the laws of physics are completely different. The learned signposts to flourishing no longer apply and new ones must be discovered. To add on to the challenge, in the working environment we hit the ground running, and the gaps between managing tasks and responsibilities—where we can seek out these edges—are thin. There is reasonable anxiety that if I took too long to establish the edges, I would be swept away by the motions of work and carried in circles, having failed to ground myself and plan a trajectory.  
From this I came to the conclusion of the necessity of a mentor, someone with years of experience I can bootstrap off, from whom I could quickly establish the possibilities and limits of the new space. Someone whose own trajectory might inspire my own.

## Expectation 2: Interest

I know myself to be an interest-driven person. Interest serves as one metric that I use to prioritise projects, and because I have collected a multitude of things I am interested in, anything outside my sphere of interest is immediately de-prioritised. On that note, I believe that interest and ownership are strongly intertwined—two properties we depart onto things. Interest is the spark but ownership keeps the flame going, one cannot sustain without the other. Of course, interest cannot make up the whole picture[^2] , but it is a pretty good signal.

## Expectation 3: Flexibility

Since my first summer internship during my undergraduate studies, I knew that a 9 to 5 job wasn’t sustainable for me in the long term. Just the expectation that I was to abide to a regular work hour schedule filled me with dread—because it just didn't make sense to me. I think I'm quite attuned to how my work output varies through the day, and a regular schedule conflicts with how I would optimise my own schedule. The same can be said about the expectation to be in the office. I attribute this to a personal fault, in that I think I'm quite influenced by the environment I am working in, and somehow a typical sterile office environment just doesn't inspire me as much as working in a cafe or a school campus[^3]. And as a data scientist where a certain level of creativity is a much needed trait, this can be detrimental.  
To that, I am thankful that the pandemic has forced us to reckon with these legacy expectations, and I hope that the flexibility offered now becomes more than a stopgap measure and instead a permanent culture.

## The fulfillment of expectations

Having been in my current company for almost a year, I will say that not all three of my expectations were met immediately. I guess that's why I was undecided on calling them wishes or expectations, for I knew that they were in fact difficult, and I would be less disappointed if wishes were not fulfilled than if expectations were not met[^4]. But calling them expectations lends certain accountability no my part to ensure that they are met, and the initial unfulfillment only reaffirmed their importance for me. Fortunately since, some changes in the currents have landed me on okay ground for now.
