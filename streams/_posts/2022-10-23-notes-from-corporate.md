When I went into my job hunt, I had for myself three  expectations for the kind of work environment that I wanted.

1. **Mentorship**  
   When I was still a student in university, I had to learn the limits and opportunities that the educational environment had to offer. These learnings had to be unlearnt at the workplace, with the learning of a new set of limits and possibilities. That's where having a good mentor comes in, someone whose experience I could bootstrap off. A mentor in two aspects, assimilating to the work environment, and learning the tacit knowledge of data science that can't be picked up in the sterile campus environment.

2. **Interest**  
   I find interest in the work a consistent motivator, and a source of developing a sense of ownership over the work. If the work aligned with my interest, I would also be confident that the work would lead to my growth, in the right direction, in my expertise. A clear interest enables goal-setting and with that, the ability to keep to a track, and not be easily distracted by other, if somewhat inevitable, responsibilities.

3. **Flexibility**  
   Since my first summer internship during my undergraduate studies, I knew that a 9 to 6 job wasn't sustainable for me in the long term, lest having to sit in at my office desk for the full workday. I attribute this to my strong desire for autonomy. Such an environment would quickly drain my soul.

Did I manage to land a position where these expecations were met? If I were to be honest, things didn't quite work out at first, and in fact, I did get _so_ close to making an early exit. Going through the initial turbulence all the more confirmed how important these three expectations were for me. But the winds of fate eventually started blowing in my direction, and carried me to a more favourable position. A position that I can  for now say I am satisfied with.
