Here we go again. This year, I managed to read 35 books in total, of which 12 were non-fiction📙 and 22 fiction📘:

I was on a non-fiction streak till like the middle of the year, when work picked up. Reading fiction is a great way to de-stress and so those made up the bulk of the later half of the year.

### Recommendations

Of these 56 books, I gave 13 books 🦷—meaning they were good to sink your teeth into. These books are:

- The World's Worst Assistant, _by Sonia Movsesian_
- How High We Go in the Dark, _by Sequoia Nagamatsu_
- Psychopolitics: Neoliberalism and New Technologies of Power, _by Byung-Chul Han_
- Babel: An Arcane History, _by R.F. Kuang_
- The Perfect Scent: A Year Inside the Perfume Industry in Paris and New York, _by Chandler Burr_
- The Gone World, _by Tom Sweterlitsch_
  
2022's list tended towards darker themes, perhaps reflecting my rather tumulous experience of transitioning into the career force. My aim for 2023 is still 50 books!
