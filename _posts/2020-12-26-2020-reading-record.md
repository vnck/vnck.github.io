description: "All the books I managed to read in 2020."

Here are all the books I managed to read in 2020, a whopping  **48** books. (My greatest achievement from the pandemic.)

Most of it was fiction (31), and my most read fiction genre was fantasy (11) (I'm a sucker for complex magic systems) followed by horror (10).

As for the non-fiction (17) genre, I mostly read books about technology (5), especially from the science, tech & society (STS) field.

My plan for 2021 is to read more widely (reading more memoirs!), but also maybe even read more, since this pandemic doesn't look like it's going away anytime soon.


_(I've put a ðŸ¦· beside the books I think are worth sinking teeth into.)_
